MAN: Computor v1 by mbiliaie:

You are in a --help mode. This is a short manual of Computor v1 project.
This program finds solutions to polynomial equations of degree less
than or equal to 2 (quadratic & linear equations).

There are additional flags in the project:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Flag "--help" for a manual & for a complete list of flags

  Flags "--usage" for Usage - how to use the computor program

* Flags "--colorb" & "--colorw" are for multicolor modes
  colorb - a color scheme for dark background
  colorw - a clolor scheme for light background

  Flag "--wiki" briefly explains my method of equation solving

  Flag "--web" a flag for simplified computor program in browser
* Flag "--nat" a flag for natural input & output

* Flag "--det" a flag for more detailed calculations
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Only one flag at a time is allowed! The default mode is monochrome.
* Add an equation as a second parameter after this flag!
Remember that an input is always considered to be well formatted.
